#### **1. Container Width**
- The container has a fixed width of **1000px**.
- The child items inside the container share this width based on their `flex-basis` and `flex-grow` values.

---

#### **2. Flex-Basis**
Each flex item has a `flex-basis` value, which acts as its starting width:
- **Item 1:** `200px`
- **Item 2:** `300px`
- **Item 3:** `100px`

The total `flex-basis` for all items is:
```
200px + 300px + 100px = 600px
```

---

#### **3. Remaining Space**
The container width is `1000px`, but the total `flex-basis` is `600px`. This leaves:
```
1000px - 600px = 400px
```
This remaining `400px` will be distributed among the items based on their `flex-grow` values.

---

#### **4. Flex-Grow Values**
The `flex-grow` values for the items determine how much of the remaining space each item gets:
- **Item 1:** `1`
- **Item 2:** `2`
- **Item 3:** `1`

The total `flex-grow` is:
```
1 + 2 + 1 = 4
```

Each "unit" of grow corresponds to:
```
400px / 4 = 100px
```

---

#### **5. Final Widths**
Each item's final width is calculated as:
```
final width = flex-basis + (flex-grow * per-unit grow space)
```

- **Item 1:**
  ```
  200px + (1 * 100px) = 300px
  ```
- **Item 2:**
  ```
  300px + (2 * 100px) = 500px
  ```
- **Item 3:**
  ```
  100px + (1 * 100px) = 200px
  ```

---

#### **6. Visual Representation**
In the updated code:
- `calc()` is used to explicitly calculate the width for each item.
- The colors and labels in the items make it easier to visualize the result:
  - **Item 1:** `300px`
  - **Item 2:** `500px`
  - **Item 3:** `200px`

### Summary:
The `flex` property dynamically adjusts the widths of the items to ensure the total container space is used efficiently, following the defined rules of `flex-basis` and `flex-grow`. This approach creates a responsive layout that adapts based on the container's width. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!
